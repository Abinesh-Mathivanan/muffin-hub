/* The above code is indeed vulnerable to buffer overflow due to the use of the `strcpy` function without proper bounds checking. Buffer overflow occurs when data is copied into a buffer without checking if the data will fit within the allocated memory space, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations.

The vulnerability is introduced in the `check_authentication` function with these lines:

```c
char password_buffer[16];
strcpy(password_buffer, password);
```

The `password_buffer` is declared with a size of 16 characters, which means it can hold up to 16 characters. However, the `strcpy` function copies the provided password into this buffer without verifying if the password's length exceeds the buffer size. If the password is longer than 16 characters, it will overflow the buffer and overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to unpredictable behavior or even crashing the program.

To address this buffer overflow vulnerability, we should ensure that the `strcpy` operation does not exceed the size of the buffer. Weu can use safer string functions like `strncpy` along with explicitly null-terminating the buffer to prevent overflow. To make it safer, we could try:

```c
int check_authentication(char *password) {
    int auth_flag = 0;
    char password_buffer[16];
    
    strncpy(password_buffer, password, sizeof(password_buffer) - 1);
    password_buffer[sizeof(password_buffer) - 1] = '\0'; // Ensure null-termination
    
    if(strcmp(password_buffer, "brillig") == 0)
        auth_flag = 1;
    if(strcmp(password_buffer, "outgrabe") == 0)
        auth_flag = 1;
    
    return auth_flag;
}
```

In this modified code, `strncpy` is used to copy the password into `password_buffer`, limiting the copy operation to the size of the buffer minus one character. This ensures that the buffer won't be overflowed. Additionally, a null-terminating character is manually added at the end to ensure the buffer is properly null-terminated.


An overflow can lead to unexpected and even contradictory behavior, allowing access without a proper password.
