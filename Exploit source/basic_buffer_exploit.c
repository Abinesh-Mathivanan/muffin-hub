/*

This code illustrates a common security vulnerability known as a buffer overflow. Buffer overflow occurs when data is placed into a memory buffer beyond its intended capacity, potentially leading to unintended consequences and security breaches. Here's a simple breakdown of what the code does:

1. **Objective:**
   We showcase the concept of buffer overflow, which can result in unexpected behavior and security risks in software applications.

2. **What It Does:**
   The code defines a C program that demonstrates the buffer overflow vulnerability. It uses the standard C library functions to work with strings and memory.

3. **How It Works:**
   - The program begins by declaring an integer variable called `value` and two character arrays, `buffer_one` and `buffer_two`, each capable of holding 8 characters.
   - It proceeds to copy the strings "one" and "two" into `buffer_one` and `buffer_two` respectively using the `strcpy` function.
   - The initial contents and memory addresses of `buffer_two`, `buffer_one`, and `value` are printed.
   - The program then attempts an unsafe operation: copying a command-line argument (provided when the program is run) into `buffer_two` using `strcpy`. This is where the buffer overflow vulnerability lies.
   - After the unsafe copy operation, the updated contents and memory addresses of `buffer_two`, `buffer_one`, and `value` are printed again. This demonstrates the impact of the buffer overflow.

4. **Why It Matters:**
   Highlights a security risk that arises when developers don't properly validate and manage input data. If a user provides a command-line argument that's longer than the allocated memory for `buffer_two`, the `strcpy` operation can overwrite adjacent memory regions, causing crashes, unintended behavior, and in some cases, unauthorized access to a system.

Remember, this code is purely for educational purposes and should not be used as an example of good coding practice. */


/* The output of the provided code can vary based on the command-line arguments passed to it when running the program. Here's an example output explanation for different scenarios:

**Scenario 1: No Command-Line Argument**
```
[BEFORE] buffer_two is at 0x7ffeee066690 and contains 'two'
[BEFORE] buffer_one is at 0x7ffeee066698 and contains 'one'
[BEFORE] value is at 0x7ffeee0666a0 and is 5 (0x00000005)

[STRCPY] copying 0 bytes into buffer_two

[AFTER] buffer_two is at 0x7ffeee066690 and contains ''
[AFTER] buffer_one is at 0x7ffeee066698 and contains 'one'
[AFTER] value is at 0x7ffeee0666a0 and is 5 (0x00000005)
```
In this scenario, no command-line argument is provided, and therefore, `argv[1]` is null. The `strcpy` operation copies 0 bytes into `buffer_two`, resulting in its content being emptied.

**Scenario 2: Command-Line Argument "Hello"**
```
[BEFORE] buffer_two is at 0x7ffeede56b10 and contains 'two'
[BEFORE] buffer_one is at 0x7ffeede56b18 and contains 'one'
[BEFORE] value is at 0x7ffeede56b20 and is 5 (0x00000005)

[STRCPY] copying 5 bytes into buffer_two

[AFTER] buffer_two is at 0x7ffeede56b10 and contains 'Hello'
[AFTER] buffer_one is at 0x7ffeede56b18 and contains 'one'
[AFTER] value is at 0x7ffeede56b20 and is 5 (0x00000005)
```
Here, the command-line argument "Hello" is provided. The `strcpy` operation copies "Hello" (5 bytes) into `buffer_two`, replacing its original content.

Please note that providing a longer command-line argument than the allocated buffer size for `buffer_two` can lead to undefined behavior, memory corruption, and even program crashes. The output may vary depending on the memory layout of your system and other factors.*/
