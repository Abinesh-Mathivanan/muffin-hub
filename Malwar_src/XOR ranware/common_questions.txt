Common Questions:

1) Where the Encryption key is stored?

The encryption key is generated using the `rand_str` function and stored in the `key` variable. The key is generated dynamically at runtime and is stored in memory:

```c
char *key;

/* Generate and allocate memory for the encryption key */
key = (char *) alloca(KEY_LEN * sizeof(char));
rand_str(key, KEY_LEN);
```

The `rand_str` function generates a random string of characters and stores it in the `key` variable. The `key` variable holds the generated encryption key throughout the execution of the program. This key is then passed to the `encrypt_file` function to perform encryption on files using the XOR operation. And as the 'rand_str' function is defined in the local scope, the memory of the variable will be deallocated after the scope.
