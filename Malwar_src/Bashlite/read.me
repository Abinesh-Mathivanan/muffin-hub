## Introduction
This folder contains the source code for a simple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) botnet implemented in C. The botnet consists of a client and a server component.

**Disclaimer:** This project is intended for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of this code for malicious activities is strictly prohibited.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of C programming language.
- A Linux-based environment (Ubuntu recommended).
- GCC compiler for C.

## Files
- `client_net.c`: The client-side code for the botnet. This program connects to the server, receives commands, and carries out DDoS attacks.
- `server_comm.c`: The server-side code that controls the botnet. It listens for incoming connections from client bots and issues commands.

## Compilation and Execution
1. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files.
2. Run the provided bash script to compile and execute the botnet components:

install.sh

This script will compile both `client_net.c` and `server_comm.c`, run them in the background, and clean up after execution.

## Usage
1. Run the compiled `server_comm` binary to start the server component of the botnet. The server will listen for incoming connections from client bots.
2. The compiled `client_net` binary will connect to the server and await commands. The botnet operator can issue commands to perform DDoS attacks or other actions.
