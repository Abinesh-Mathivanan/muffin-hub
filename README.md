Muffin Hub is where you can find some cool stuff, including exploit source codes, malware, viruses, and other hacking-related goodies. 

I write most of the code for myself and in some cases, I even take references and post them here. This repository contains malware source code samples, hacking tools, exploit source codes, and viruses, I uploaded it to GitHub to simplify the process for those who want to analyze the code.

Misuse of the information in this repository can result in criminal charges being brought against the persons in question. I will not be held responsible if any criminal charges are brought against any individuals misusing the code in this repository to break the law.
